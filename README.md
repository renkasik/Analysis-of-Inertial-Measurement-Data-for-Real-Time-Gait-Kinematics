# Analysis-of-Inertial-Measurement-Data-for-Real-Time-Gait-Kinematics
The code for my bachelors thesis titled "Analysis of Inertial Measurement Data for Real-Time Gait Kinematics"

The code is in a Jupyter Notebook and written with Python. It has the codes for:
- Preprocessing of raw data
- Filtering of preprocessed data
- Custom functions for finding, extereme points, inflection points and walking periods
- Visualizations

  The visualizations have errors under them, because of a compatibilty issue with the timestamps in the x-axis. Despite the errors, the code for visualization works when the code cells, needed for the visualization, are ran individually. The problem occurs only when the 'run all' command is used.
